zmv [ -finqQsvwW ] [ -C | -L | -M | -p program ] [ -o optstring ] srcpat dest
Move (usually, rename) files matching the pattern srcpat to corresponding files having names of the form given by dest, where srcpat contains parentheses surrounding patterns which will be replaced in turn by $1, $2, ... in dest. For example,
zmv '(*).lis' '$1.txt'
renames 'foo.lis' to 'foo.txt', 'my.old.stuff.lis' to 'my.old.stuff.txt', and so on.
The pattern is always treated as an EXTENDED_GLOB pattern. Any file whose name is not changed by the substitution is simply ignored. Any error (a substitution resulted in an empty string, two substitutions gave the same result, the destination was an existing regular file and -f was not given) causes the entire function to abort without doing anything.

Options:

-f
Force overwriting of destination files. Not currently passed down to the mv/cp/ln command due to vagaries of implementations (but you can use -o-f to do that).

-i

Interactive: show each line to be executed and ask the user whether to execute it. 'Y' or 'y' will execute it, anything else will skip it. Note that you just need to type one character.

-n

No execution: print what would happen, but don't do it.

-q

Turn bare glob qualifiers off: now assumed by default, so this has no effect.

-Q

Force bare glob qualifiers on. Don't turn this on unless you are actually using glob qualifiers in a pattern.

-s

Symbolic, passed down to ln; only works with -L.

-v

Verbose: print each command as it's being executed.

-w

Pick out wildcard parts of the pattern, as described above, and implicitly add parentheses for referring to them.

-W

Just like -w, with the addition of turning wildcards in the replacement pattern into sequential ${1} .. ${N} references.

-C

-L

-M

Force cp, ln or mv, respectively, regardless of the name of the function.

-p program
Call program instead of cp, ln or mv. Whatever it does, it should at least understand the form 'program -- oldname newname' where oldname and newname are filenames generated by zmv.

-o optstring
The optstring is split into words and passed down verbatim to the cp, ln or mv command called to perform the work. It should probably begin with a '-'.

For more complete examples and other implementation details, see the zmv source file, usually located in one of the directories named in your fpath, or in Functions/Misc/zmv in the zsh distribution.
