# --- TODO ---

### Error Checking
# => check if target filname already exists
  # error on name collisions or continue and report after?
# => check permissions
  # abort right away if permissions are lacking
# => is file locked?
# => error catching

# => lock files during name changes?  nesessary?


### Selecting Files (PATTERN stuff) ###

# => Regex support?
# => Wildcard & globbing support!

### All option; -a --all
# => disregard PATTERN matching; do these things to all files.
# => Only able to be used in append, prepend, indexes, upcase, downcase, sentencecase
# => only compatible with some operations

### Inclusion Mode; -I --include
# => perform operations on the whole filename found by a PATTERN match
# => implied with propercase or sentencecase
# => only compatible with some operations.

### Inversion Mode?; -i --invert
# => Invert results from PATTERN match
# => instead of: "affect only matches"; acts like: "affect only not matches". 
# => only compatible with some operations.
  # => not substitution

### Ignore PATTERN case; -

### File Extension Support? (.pdf, .xls, ...); -x --extensions
# => Add supplied extensions onto files that do not have extensions
# => Change all extensions
# => Delete all extensions
# => Delete extensions that match PATTERN
# => Preserve extensions that match PATTERN
# => PATTERN + Gsub! only extensions <- not needed with wildcards?

  # => x - restrict changes to only extensions
  # => -ix - exclude extensions from changes; preserve extensions


### Meta ###

### Version option; -v --version
# => print program version

### Help; -h --help
# => display rudimentary help


### Reporting and data ###

### Confirmation; default behavior
# => report proposed changes and request confirmation of intent
# => require a full yes/no, not y/n?

### Step confirmation; -S --step
# => Steps through each file and requests y/n confirmation

### Force; -f --force
# => operate renames without user confirmation

### Print; -p --print
# => print a formated list of renamed files after execution
# => number of files changed
# => errors encountered
# => how does this work with the confirmation mode?

### Test; -t --test
# => dry run w/ print
# => does not change files

### Verbose Mode; -V --verbose
# => show renames and progress in situ




### Actions ###

### Default Mode; Gsub based
# => batch.rename PATTERN replacementtext

### Uppercase; -U --uppercase
### Lowercase; -l --lowercase
### Sentencecase; -s --sentence

### Append; -A --append
# => Append ___ to files
# => Append with index?
# => auto number based on date/time
# => auto number from range

### Prepend; -P --prepend
# => Prepend ___ to files
# => prepend with index?
# => auto number based on date/time
# => auto number from range

### Trim;
# => trim first x
# => trim last x


### Recursive Rename; -r --recurse
# => default to a confirmation to prevent chaos?


### Related features and questions: ###

### Directory Handling?
# => -D --directories (rename (only or additionally) directories as well?)
# => how does the current script behave with directories?

### Target renames into another directory?
# => batch.rename --target ~/bob/albums PATTERN replacementtext

# make compatible with windows?


###############
### Process ###
###############

# => Parse Args
# => Get files -> get list of files
# => Perform Actions

#Object -> start with a hash of all file names in directory

### Rename Engine Structure ###

### Mode Structure
# => Multiple modes? Original PATTERN + GSUB not the heart of the script?
# => Or make the Original PATTERN + GSUB mode heliocentric, with all other
  # functionality requiring options?

# => modular
# => enable features & engine differences with flags?
# => write seperate cases depending on options?
  # => not very flexible, harder to use seperate options together
# => seperate cases and modifier options (with flags?)
